### NOW
* Handle seed
   * Add get_seed and set_seed in game_statistics
   * Save seed with database_manager
* Solve the issue with bot and doors
   * Try with buffer, if it's still not working, slowmotion
* Handle properly game end after n turns
   * Actually, there's the issue with "too many hacks running now"
   * Some ideas :
       * See in detail how is nethack working and exit with the proper way.
       * Clean appropriated data after/before each game via a script
* Handle bot name
   * Two Possibilities :
       * Bot name given as a parameter
       * Bot name given by the bot.
   * Ensure a table bot is created
   * If bot is not in the database : add it
   * Get bot id
   * Add bot id to game result
* Verify Makefile dependency
   * If we modify a pfa src file, nethack should be rebuilt partially
   * If we modify a pfa header file, some nethack files should rebuilt too.

### LATER
* Choose what kind of analysis we want to do
* Start producing statistiques
   * Disabling all outputs
   * Getting datas direclty by sqlite3 or with a c interface?
   * How to plot graphs needed
* Write other bots
   * A bot with a memory, trying to reach the less reached square
