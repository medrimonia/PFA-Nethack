### NOW
* Verify Makefile dependency
   * If we modify a pfa src file, nethack should be rebuilt partially
   * If we modify a pfa header file, some nethack files should rebuilt too.
   * If we modify one of the .def file, according pfa files should be rebuilt
* Update doc
   * Everywhere
* Document game_runner script (usage etc)
* Verify indentation (particularly for ludovic)
   * only spaces ?

### OPTIONAL
* Solve an issue with game_runner
   * nethack-3.4.3/nethack script has a hard reference to the nethack program
* Reduce the time during which the database is used
   * Store all datas in the process and push them to the database at end
* Use a better database
   * Avoid multiple existence of field
   * Make reference to game id in doors discovery etc
   * Use a table for bots (name, id and eventually version)
