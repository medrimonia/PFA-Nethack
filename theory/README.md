This whole folder contains only files related to the study of the problem
consisting of getting out of a 10*10 room where there is a secret door hidden.

##compare.gnuplot
This file is a script to use with gnuplot with the following command :
```gnuplot compare.gnuplot```
This file produce a graphic comparing the experimental probability to the
theorical average result. It needs the presence of _result\_from\_db_ and
_result.txt_.
The output is _compare.png_.

##from\_db.sh
This shell script allows the user to create a result file associating the
probability of finding the door in _k_ moves or less with _k_. The
informations are read in a database, the path to that database can be modified
in the script.

##min\_search.py
This program in python calculate the probability that the door is discovered
in _k_ moves or less and in exactly _k_ moves if the strategy used is to avoid
research as much as possible. The limit for _k_ is defined by an epsilon such
as if the probability of finding the door in exactly _k_ move is lower than
epsilon the computation is stopped.

##result_from_db
This file is generated by _from\_db.sh_, the database used contains a set of
100 games with the diffusion bot.

##results.txt
This file contains the result of min\_search.py execution.

##theory.tex
This file contains a report in english about the theoric study of the 10*10
problem
