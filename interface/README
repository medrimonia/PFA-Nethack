In order to use this program, you need to install the following modules from
the CPAN:
	- IO::Tty
	- IO::Pty::Easy
	- Term::ReadKey

Installation can be done using the 'cpan -i <module>' command after you've
properly configured your cpan.

Alternatively, you can install cpanminus (a zero-conf CPAN client) and run
'cpanm <module>'. See https://metacpan.org/module/cpanm for more details.

In order to install these modules without root privileges, you can use
local::lib. See https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib.
